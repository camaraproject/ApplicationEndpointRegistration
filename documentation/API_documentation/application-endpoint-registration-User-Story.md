# Application Endpoint Registration API User Story

| **Item** | **Details** |
| ---- | ------- |
| ***Summary*** | As an application developer who has deployed my application across multiple Edge Cloud Zones, I need a way to register and manage the endpoints of my application instances. The Application Endpoint Registration API allows me to register my application endpoints across different Edge Cloud Zones, update their information when necessary, retrieve endpoint details, and remove endpoints when they are decommissioned. This registration process enables the discovery of these endpoints through the Application Endpoint Discovery API, ensuring users can connect to the optimal instance of my application. |
| ***Roles, Actors and Scope*** | **Roles:** API Consumer:Developer<br> **Actors:** Application service providers, hyperscalers, application developers<br> **Scope:** <ul><li>Register application endpoints in various Edge Cloud Zones</li><li>Update existing application endpoint information</li><li>Retrieve application endpoint details</li><li>Delete application endpoints when no longer needed</li></ul> |
| ***Pre-conditions*** |The preconditions are listed below:<br><ol><li>The API Consumer:BusinessManager and API Consumer:Administrator have been onboarded to the API Exposure Platform.</li><li>The API Consumer:BusinessManager has successfully subscribed to the Application Endpoint Registration product from the product catalog.</li><li>The API Consumer:Administrator has onboarded the developer:User to the platform.</li><li>The API Consumer has deployed application instances across various Edge Cloud Zones and has the necessary information about each endpoint.</li><li>The means to get the access token are known to the API Consumer:User to ensure secure access of the API.</li></ol> |
| ***Activities/Steps*** | **Starts when:** <br>1. The API consumer application server makes requests to:
   - Register a new application endpoint by providing endpoint details.
   - Retrieve information about a specific registered endpoint.
   - Update the details of an existing registered endpoint.
   - Delete a registered endpoint that is no longer active.<br><br>**Ends when:** <br>1. The API endpoint successfully processes the registration, update, retrieval, or deletion request. |
| ***Post-conditions*** | 1. For registration: A new application endpoint is registered and available for discovery.<br>2. For update: The application endpoint information is updated with the latest details.<br>3. For retrieval: The current information about the application endpoint is provided.<br>4. For deletion: The application endpoint is removed from the registration system and will no longer be discoverable. |
| ***Exceptions*** | Several exceptions might occur <br>- Unauthorized: Not valid credentials (e.g. use of already expired access token).<br>- Invalid input: Not valid input data to register or update an endpoint (e.g. malformed URI).<br>- Conflict: An endpoint with the same identifier already exists during registration.<br>- Not Found: The requested endpoint doesn't exist during retrieval, update, or deletion operations.|

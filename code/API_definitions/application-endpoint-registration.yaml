  version: 0.1.0

  description: |
    The Application Endpoints Registration API provides a programmable
    interface for developers to register the endpoints of an application
    which is deployed across various Edge Cloud Zones.
    It allows developers to retrieve, update, and delete those registrations.

    # Introduction

    The API registers the Application Endpoints.
    This information can be used for various use cases like optimal endpoint
    discovery to help end users connect to the most optimal instance of the
    application which is distributed across various Edge Cloud Zones.
    Additionally the information can be used to monitor the edge instances to
    take decisions from a lifecycle management perspective. The API provides
    the ability to register, read and manage the deployed edge instances of
    the application.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Application Endpoint**:

    The Endpoint on which the application is accessible.
    It can be a FQDN, IPv4, or IPv6 address with a port number.

    * **Application Profile**:

    It represents the application's network and
    compute characteristics. This helps distinguish between different
    applications and their specific requirements.

    * **Edge Cloud Zone**:

    Availability Zone in an Edge Cloud. It is the lowest
    level of abstraction exposed to an Application Provider who wants to
    deploy an Application on Edge Cloud. Availability Zones exist within
    a Region.

    # API functionality

    The API provides the following operations:
    - POST registerApplicationEndpoints: Registers the Application Endpoints
                    of a deployed application to a specified edge cloud zone.
    - GET getAllRegisteredApplicationEndpoints: Returns endpoint information for
      all registered Applications.
    - GET getApplicationEndpointsByID: Returns endpoint information for all
        Applications registered to a specified applicationEndpointListId.
    - PUT updateApplicationEndpoint: Update registered application endpoint
        information.
    - DELETE deregisterApplicationEndpoint: Deregister an application's
                          Endpoints.
    ## Errors

    - If the API call contains a formatting or any other syntactic error,
    a `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
    - If the API call cannot be authenticated due to missing, invalid, or
    expired credentials, a `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` error is returned.
    - If the API call has a valid access token that does not have the
    required scope, then a `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` error is returned.
    - If the API call has an `applicationEndpointListId` that does not identify
    any registered endpoint on the Edge Cloud, a `404 NOT_FOUND` error
    is returned.

    ### Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive.
    Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error
    statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release
    associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses.
    The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API
    Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible
    error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how
    an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to
    Identity and Consent Management
    (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/)
    for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the
    onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the
    API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the
    API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated
    by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise
    their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of
    three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains
    in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of
    transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

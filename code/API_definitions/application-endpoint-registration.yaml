  description: |
    The Application Endpoints Registration API provides a programmable
    interface for developers to register the endpoints of an application
    which is deployed across various Edge Cloud Zones.
    It allows developers to retrieve, update, and delete those registrations.

    # Introduction

    The API registers the Edge Application Endpoints.
    This information can be used for various use cases like optimal endpoint
    discovery to help end users connect to the most optimal instance of the
    application which is distributed across various Edge Cloud Zones.
    Additionally the information can be used to monitor the edge instances to
    take decisions from a lifecycle management perspective. The API provides
    the ability to register, read and manage the deployed edge instances of
    the application.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Application Endpoint**:

    The Endpoint on which the application is accessible.
    It can be a FQDN, IPv4, or IPv6 address with a port number.

    # API functionality

    The API provides the following operations:
    - POST registerApplicationEndpoints: Registers the Application Endpoints
                    of a deployed application to a specified edge cloud zone.
    - GET getAllRegisteredApplicationEndpoints: Returns endpoint information for
      all registered Applications.
    - GET getApplicationEndpointsByID: Returns endpoint information for all
        Applications registered to a specified applicationEndpointId.
    - PUT updateApplicationEndpoint: Update registered application endpoint
        information.
    - DELETE deregisterApplicationEndpoint: Deregister an application's
                          application Endpoint from the edge cloud zone.
    ## Errors

    - If the API call contains a formatting or other any other syntatic error,
    a `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
    - If the API call cannot be authenticated due to missing, invalid, or
    expired credentials, a `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` error is returned.
    - If the API call has a valid access token that does not have the
    required scope, then a `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` error is returned.
    - If the API call has an `applicationEndpointsId` that does not identify
    any registered endpoint on the Edge Cloud, a `404 NOT_FOUND` error
    is returned.

    ### Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive.
    Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error
    statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release
    associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses.
    The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API
    Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible
    error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.
                          

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details on
    how a client requests an access token. Please refer to Identify and
    Consent Management
    (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/)
    for the released version of the Profile.

    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined
    during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the
    Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared
    purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing
     legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data
    is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through
    mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access
    tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in
    strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations,
    upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.
